# Draw anime intelligently 


#### Context
Begginings of a side project I decided to try out. 
As someone who was looking to improve their character linework by posting their drawings on art forums and getting overlayed corrections from other members as feedback,
I thought it would be pretty useful to have a webapp that would suggest personalized corrections automatically based on user input and train them to be better artists.
