# Draw anime intelligently 


#### Context
Beginnings of a side project I decided to try out. As someone who was looking to improve their character line work by posting their drawings on art forums and receiving overlaid corrections from other members as feedback, I thought it would be pretty useful to have a web app that would suggest personalized corrections automatically based on user input and train them to become better artists.
